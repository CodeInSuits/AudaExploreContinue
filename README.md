OHML 
======
**OHML** is a product coming out of AudaExplore Hackathon. This android app is aimed to help AudaExplore San Diego revolutionalize the user experience during damage evaluation process after car incidents.
**Macco** is its predecessor, based on which **OHML** improved its UI/UX design, cameraview features, and a new humorous vocal guiding system. 
It offers a new range of possibilities for **Macco** as **OHML** changed its ways of automating damage evaluation process. It reversed the user input process
by helping user to locate damage parts through camera view features first, so that users will have a better sense of their cars' conditions when they enter
the heapmap mode.
