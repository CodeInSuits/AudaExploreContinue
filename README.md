OHML 
======
**OHML** is a product coming out of AudaExplore Hackathon. This android app is aimed to help AudaExplore San Diego revolutionalize the user experience during damage evaluation process after car incidents.
**Macco** is its predecessor, based on which **OHML** improved its UI/UX design, cameraview features, and a new humorous vocal guiding system. 
It offers a new range of possibilities for **Macco** as **OHML** changed its ways of automating damage evaluation process. It reversed the user input process
by helping user to locate damage parts through camera view features first, so that users will have a better sense of their cars' conditions when they enter
the heapmap mode. Moreover, **OHML** imported the latest image capturing feature adopted by OpenCV library. This significantly improved user experience by offering the advanced auto-capture features. Users just need to hold the camera(with the camera view feature)towards their damaged cars and after certain time period, **OHML** will auto-focus on the matched parts and take photos. This is very practical during evaluation process as it reduces the chances where users might not send accurate photos and thus reduce the evaluation efficiency.

#### Then user would be asked to indicate damaged area using **Macco** HeapMap mode that utilizes Blender3D. Then through **HeapMap Vision**, an associated android app also designed by me, customers would have a clearer view when they match the new templates for insurance evaluation.
